= SubEthaSMTP Wiser =

Wiser is a smart replacement for [http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/ Dumbster].

A few benefits of Wiser over Dumbster are:
  * Very simple to use 
  * Works properly with MacOS X
  * Uses the JavaMail API
  * Works properly with Unicode characters. Confirmed by lots of Japanese Wiser users.

== How To Use It ==
Include the following jars on your classpath:
  * subetha-smtp.jar
  * slf4j-api-X.X.X.jar
  * One of the slf4j connectors such as slf4j-simple-X.X.X.jar
  * JavaMail (mail.jar and activation.jar)

Using Wiser is trivial:
{{{

Wiser wiser = new Wiser();
wiser.setPort(2500); // Default is 25
wiser.start();

}}}
 
Now, use a mail client to send email to your Wiser server. To get your JavaMail messages out of the Wiser server, just use this code:
{{{

for (WiserMessage message : wiser.getMessages())
{
	String envelopeSender = message.getEnvelopeSender();
	String envelopeReceiver = message.getEnvelopeReceiver();

	MimeMessage mess = message.getMimeMessage();

	// now do something fun!
}

}}}

It really doesn't get more simple than that! =)
